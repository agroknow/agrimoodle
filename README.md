The **agriMoodle** bundle is based on a fresh Moodle fork, that:

  - provides great green/agri- templates and themes
  - is linked to interesting green/agri- information sources
  - trainers can use tools to import resources from relevant repositories
  - trainers can use an easy LOM editor to describe and export metadata for their resources
  - learners can benefit from (automatic) references to useful material, through various widgets
