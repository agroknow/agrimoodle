=== 2.5 ===

required changes:
* Functions core_course_renderer::course_category_tree() and course_category_tree_category()
  are deprecated

  several functions such as print_courses(), print_whole_category_list(), print_category_info()

  See http://docs.moodle.org/dev/Courses_lists_upgrade_to_2.5

DOM changes:
* changed the h1 title in the help popup to a h2.
* new setting $THEME->yuicssmodules = array('cssreset', 'cssfonts', 'cssgrids', 'cssbase'); which
  allows themes to use different CSS reset normalisers such as cssnormalize YUI module.

  the table in the process (see MDL-35608).
* Cancel buttons have the class btn-cancel.
* Added a z-index for the div#dateselector-calendar-panel so that the calendar pop-up renders above
  the filemanager when they overlap, ie. the course settings page (see MDL-39047).
* Trivial change of CSS selectors used to display plugin status at the plugins overview
  screen (#plugins-control-panel).
